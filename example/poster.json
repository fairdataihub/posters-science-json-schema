      "description": "This poster presents the Actionable Guidelines for FAIR Research Software Task Force, established in December 2024 under the Research Software Alliance (ReSA). The Task Force addresses the challenge that FAIR4RS principles, while providing a framework for making research software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, lack concrete implementation steps. Through a comprehensive, community-driven methodology involving six subgroups conducting literature reviews and community outreach, the Task Force aims to create actionable and domain-agnostic guidelines for implementing the FAIR4RS principles. The poster outlines the background, problem statement, proposed solution, current progress including preliminary findings on metadata for software reuse, and next steps toward releasing draft guidelines in March 2026 and the first official version in Summer 2026. The Task Force brings together approximately 12 active members from diverse international locations (Germany, Spain, UK, USA, etc.) and research domains (Biomedical, Data Science, Knowledge Representation, etc.).",

The methodology includes personal assessment, literature review, and external feedback to establish answers for outstanding questions related to the 17 FAIR4RS principles. The subgroup working on category C5 has identified preliminary findings suggesting that provenance metadata (authors info, funding details) and other metadata (software description, required dependencies) are essential for software reuse, with codemeta.json identified as a method to provide this metadata.",

They are now being adopted by researchers, organizations, and funders worldwide."

Illustration of the outcomes of task 1 of the Task Force, which consisted of understanding the requirements of each of the 17 FAIR4RS principles.\n\n17 FAIR4RS principles → 6 main categories → Many questions!\n\nWe identified 6 categories where actionable guidelines are needed:\n- C1.
